    <p>4theRodentz offers a fun Pokemon-Go-esque animal tracking game in order
        to track the environmental impact of global warming on rodents. The
        Portland Zoo created an app to track pikas; this app is an extention of that.
        4therodentz is an open source program that tracks rodent populations in the Greater Portland
        Area. With the data collected by your submissions, scientists can start hypothesising the
        affect of global warming on larger animal populations. Rodent afficianadoes and beginners alike can enter their
        data
        through our submissions page. We ask you simple question, like the type of rodent you saw,
        the size of the rodent, the area where you saw it, and the time of the sighting. </p>
