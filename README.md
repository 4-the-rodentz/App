# App
4theRodentz offers a fun Pokemon-Go-esque animal tracking game in order to track the environmental impact of global warming on rodents.
The Portland Zoo is tracking pikas, so we wanted to make an app that allowed you open source program in order to track rodents in the Greater Portland Area. Rodent afficianadoes and beginners alike can enter their data, which includes prompts like the size of the rodent, and explains easily recognizable rodent features.   
The website will require users to have a username and a password in order to submit information. The website will have a HOME PAGE, A SUBMISSION FORM, MODAL [SIGN UP PAGE] and RESULTS PAGE. The results will include charts and more information on other users' inputs. 
The app gives rewards to users adding more than a certain amount of data.

Inspirations include the bird spotting app "Merlin" and Pokemon-Go
